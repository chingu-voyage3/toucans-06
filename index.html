            <h3>8 Tips for Attracting Millenial Donors</h3>

            <p>The charitable giving landscape is changing. Millennials currently represent the largest portion of the population and are projected to have $30,000,000,000,000 of wealth transferred to them over the next 30 years. That’s 30 trillion dollars in case you didn’t have time to count all 13 zeros.</p>

            <p>And although my generation is thought of as collection of selfie-obsessed narcissists, we actually donate quite generously to charitable organizations. The thing is if you want our money, you are going to have to change your donation game.</p>

            <p>Don’t worry; we at Elevation Web have compiled 8 tips to help you evolve with the times.</p>

          <p>For the first time in history there are 4 (almost five) generations apart of the American workforce. It was inevitable of course; people are living longer and retiring later.  While the the diverse talents of cross-generational offices lead to more creative problem-solving and the creation of unique projects and friendships, these inter-generational offices are bringing new challenges to managers.</p>

            Creating a website is not a quick and easy task. It can be challenging for a nonprofit with small team and limited resources but <span class="quote-standout">my experience with Elevation made it much simpler!</span> I appreciated the team's organization and direction. <span class="quote-standout">I always felt like I knew what was happening next and what I needed to get done.</span> The team was responsive and able to translate what we were looking for. I love our new site, it truly represents the professionalism and uniqueness of our social enterprise Pedal Revolution. Many thanks to Elevation!
